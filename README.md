## About
Move the "Windows Kits" folder without causing serious errors.
## Usage Method
1. Download the compressed package and unzip the file into a new folder.
2. Run "start.bat" as Administrator.
3. Enter the path <font color=red>(please see [Note](#note) for input rules)</font> and wait for the program to run.
### <span id='note'>Note</span>
* The path is the parent folder of "Windows Kits". <br>
For example, if "D:\\Windows Kits", you should enter "D:\\".<br>
* Both entries follow the above rules.
## Version comparison
Compared with the previous version (although it has not been released), this version has flexibility, and users can specify the path. The robustness of the program has also been improved.
